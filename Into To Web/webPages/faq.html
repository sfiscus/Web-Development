    <h3 id="construction">What is Artist of the World?</h3>
    
    <p id="offOurChest">
     Artists of the World is a non-profit organization that connects artisans 
     and crafters from around the world directly to the customer.  It provides 
     an income to struggling artists and provides high-quality, low cost art 
     and handicrafts to the customer.  The customer saves money by eliminating 
     the markup costs of retail establishments.
     </p>
     
     <h3>
      Does Artists of the World charge the artists when a sale is made?
     </h3>
     
     <p>
     No. The sale is made directly between the seller and the buyer. 
     Artists of the World provides the service for free.  From time to time 
     artisans send a donation for the maintenance of the Web site and Internet 
     service provider fees.  This is entirely optional since for many of the
     artisans this is their only source of income.

     <h3>
      Who are the artists?  Are any of them corporations?
     </h3>
     
      <p>
      Most of the artists are people from poorer communities but with 
      rich traditions, working to earn a living, often in developing countries.  
      Artists of the World does not allow corporations to sell goods on their 
      site. Developing nations may use cooperatives representing a group of
      artists.
      </p>
     
     
      <h3>
      Who maintains the Web site?
      </h3>
     
      <p>
      Mostly volunteers and students.  We use student interns for much 
      of the actual Web site construction and maintenance as well as maintaining
      the database.  
      </p>
     
     
     <h3>
      Do you accept volunteers, and if so, how does one apply?
     </h3>
     
      <p>
      Yes, we do accept the services of volunteers and have a limited 
      number of student internships available from time to time.  
      Please contact us at <a href>development@artedelmundo.com</a>.
      </p>
     
      <h3>
       Does Artists of the World accept donations?
      </h3>
     
      <p>
      By all means!  We are a registered charity and all contributions 
      are tax deductible in the United States.  Receipts are provided for all 
      donations. Please contact us at <a href>donations@artedelmundo.com</a>.

        <h2 id="questionBox">Questions For The Artist</h2> 
        
      <h3>
      What if I have a question for the artist?
      </h3>
        
      <p>
        Contact the artist directly using their email address.  Please be 
        patient since most of the artists do not have direct Internet 
        connections.  They use either public facilities or Internet cafes.
        Often they use Hotmail or some other free public email account.
      </p>
     
      <p>
        Most of the artists encourage potential customers to send email so that 
        they can answer specific questions about their products and to offer 
        customization of their products. Artists are often open to negotiations 
        for purchases a number of products (a quantity discount).
      </p>

     <article>
     
      <h3 id="packageInfo">
      Order Information
      </h3>
      
       <h3>
       How is the order shipped?
       </h3>
       
      <p>
        This is also the responsibility of the artists selling the product.  
        Artists of the World does not assume any responsibility for orders. 
        Once an order has been placed, the local artist will determine the best 
        method of shipment.  Often they send an email confirmation to the buyer.
      </p>
       
       <h3>
       How is the order paid for?
       </h3>
       
      <p>
        The order is paid using an international money order, directly to the 
        artist.  If the price of the art work is in local currency, it is up to
        the buyer and seller to determine the correct price. Price conversion 
        sites are available on the Web.  A recommended site is: The Currency 
        Converter at <a href>http://www.xe.net/ucc/</a>.
      </p> 
       
       <h3>
       What if a product has been damaged in transit?
       </h3>
       
      <p>
        The customer should contact the shipping company and start the process 
        of investigating the problem.  Most artists carefully package their 
        product to avoid damage, but often the packaging material is newspaper. 
        Artists are informed to be careful to include enough padding for
        safe transit. If the artist has failed to package the material for 
        international shipment, it is their responsibility to provide a 
        replacement product. This is part of the agreement that artists that
        artists accept when signing up to use the Artists of the World Web site.
      </p>
         
      <h3>
       Have there been any instances of artists not shipping the product or 
       other problems with deception?
      </h3>
       
      <p>
        Not really, although there  have been a few complaints about the length
        of time it takes to receive the product. Most of the artists are 
        grateful for this service and do not abuse it.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        What is a reasonable time that it takes for a shipment to arrive?
      </h3>
       
      <p>
        Many shipments arrive anywhere from one to four weeks. However, some 
        artists create customized products for the customer and these may take 
        longer. If the shipment is excessively delayed, the artist has the 
        responsibility of contacting the customer. We encourage customers to
        email artists if they are concerned about a product that has not arrived
        or to inquire if a product has been shipped.

      Customization
      </h3>
      
       <h3>
       Can products be customized by the artist?
       </h3>
       
      <p>
        This really depends on the artist. Some artists make a 'standard' 
        product while others will allow customers to specify colors, patterns, 
        and so on. One example of this is in the area of carpet weaving.  
        Some of the artists will allow the customers to specify the color used 
        in the pattern so that the carpet matches the customers other home 
        furnishing items.
      </p>
      
       <h3>
       Are any of the items numbered or otherwise uniquely identified in the 
       event that they become collectibles?
       </h3>
       
      <p>
        Some artists do uniquely number their products. Many artists include a 
        signature, date, country or other identification located in an 
        inconspicious place on the product. A few of the artists have a personal
        story, legend or other unique history of the product.

      <h3>
      Will you be adding new types of items in the future?
      </h3>
        
      <p>
        Yes. Artists of the World is constantly adding new artists.  We are 
        also thinking of adding agricultural products, such as Fair Trade 
        coffee at a related site.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Other products may include spices, herbs and other specialty goods 
        that are available locally.
