     <h2>Who Can Be a Friend? Everyone!</h2>
  
      <p>
        Anyone can become a Friend of Arte Del Mundo, and help this worthy 
        enterprise to grow and prosper. You don't have to know anything about
        art. In fact, one of the benefits of becoming a Friend is that you can
        learn about various kinds of art, and how the artists create their works.
        See the benefits list below.
