        <h3 id="theBeginning">Early Life</h3>
        
         <p id="littleBoutMe">
         Sean Fiscus began making art at a very young age. His gift was the gift
         of song and he would share it with anyone who would stop to hear him.
         He found great joy and power through music. He was able to bring a smile 
         to almost everyone he came in contact with. Which is a characteristic 
         that would stay with him to this day.
         </p>
         
         <h3 id="gettingOlder">Adolescence</h3>
         <p>
         During his adolescent years he attended a private high school which
         opened his mind up more to the arts. It was here that he came in contact
         with many teachers who would encourage him and mold him into the great 
         artist he is today. It was here that he would meet the woman of his dreams
         and the woman he would eventually marry.
         </p>
         
         <h3 id="thisISIT">Adult Life</h3>
         <p>
         His adult life was full of struggle. He spent many years in school 
         unsure just what exactly he wanted to choose for a career path. He 
         desperately wanted to have a job in the arts but felt that he needed 
         something to fall back on. So he spent many years at the University of 
         Wisconsin until he choose to finish a degree in Computer Science. He is 
         happily married and still continues to participate in his dream whenever
         he isn't busy in school. His dream would to one day star in the upcoming
         Hollywood film Mass Effect, as the lead role of Commander Shepard. His
         other dream would be to one day play Batman. Oh that already happened 
         BECAUSE HE IS!!!
